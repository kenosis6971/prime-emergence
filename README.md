# Prime Emergence in Prime Exponent Space

This repository hosts the **Prime Emergence Project**, a research program that reinterprets prime numbers as **structural rupture events** in a novel representation called **Prime Exponent Space (PE-space)**.  
Primes are shown to arise not as random anomalies, but as inevitable dimension-creation events â€” the **canonical carries** â€” when symbolic redistribution fails.

## ðŸ“– Contents
- **Master Paper (LaTeX):**  
  *Prime Emergence in Prime Exponent Space: Rupture Dynamics and Canonical Structure*  
  A unified synthesis covering canonical carries, rupture dynamics, the Saffron Spiral geometry, symbolic field theory, and the universal emergence principle.
  
- **Supporting Papers (PDFs):**  
  Earlier focused papers, including:  
  - *Phase Transitions in PE-Space*  
  - *The Saffron Synthesis*  
  - *Symbolic Field Theory in PE-Space*  
  - *The Architecture of Emergence*  
  - *Fractures in Number Space*  
  - *Canonical Carry & Verification Pipeline*

- **Code:**  
  `saffron_synthesis_master_v3_monolith.py` â€” reference implementation of rupture detection, $\Phi$ computation, wheel sieving, and verification pipeline.

- **Figures & Visualizations:**  
  Saffron Spiral plots, rupture ridgelines, Fibonacci overlays, and symbolic field maps.

## âœ¨ Highlights
- Defines **tension**, **curvature**, and the normalized **$\Phi$ detector** for predicting prime emergence.  
- Projects rupture dynamics onto the **Saffron Spiral**, revealing coherent ridgelines of prime activity.  
- Demonstrates a **recall-first pipeline** (wheel sieves + $\Phi$ threshold + orthogonal Millerâ€“Rabin verifier) achieving perfect empirical recall and precision across tested ranges.  
- Situates prime emergence within a **universal law of irreducibility**: all irreducible structures appear when redistribution fails.
